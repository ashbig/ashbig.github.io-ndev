3-dimensional representation of a force-directed iterative layout, using [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph). This component uses [ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)/WebGL for rendering and either [d3-force-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/d3-force-3d) or [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.forcelayout3d) for the 3D physics engine.

Cycle through various topological data sets using the button on the top-right.
